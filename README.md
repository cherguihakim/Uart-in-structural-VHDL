#UART Implementation in VHDL
Project Overview
This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) system using VHDL on an Altera DE2 FPGA board. The UART system is designed to facilitate serial communication between devices without requiring a shared clock signal. The implementation includes both transmitter and receiver modules, a programmable baud rate generator, and a test environment.

Features
Asynchronous Serial Communication: Handles data transmission and reception without a shared clock.
Configurable Baud Rate: Includes a programmable baud rate generator for flexible communication speeds.
Loopback Testing: Validates the system's functionality by looping transmitted data back to the receiver.
CMOS to RS-232 Signal Conversion: Ensures compatibility with external devices using a MAX232 chip.
Integration with External Systems: Tested with serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY) to display transmitted messages.
Strict RTL Design Principles: Designed using structural modeling and avoiding behavioral modeling for optimal timing and synthesis.
Design Components
1. UART Transmitter
Converts parallel data to serial format.
Includes a shift register for serializing data.
Programmable baud rate synchronization ensures accurate timing.
2. UART Receiver
Converts serial data back to parallel format.
Detects the start and stop bits for accurate data framing.
Implements error checking to validate received data integrity.
3. Baud Rate Generator
Generates clock signals for baud rate timing.
Configurable to support common baud rates (e.g., 9600, 115200).
4. Testbench
Simulates UART communication in a loopback configuration.
Validates data transmission and reception functionality.
Hardware Requirements
FPGA Board: Altera DE2 or equivalent.
MAX232 Chip: For signal level conversion between CMOS and RS-232.
Serial Terminal Software: PuTTY or similar for monitoring communication.
